1) This code smell is that these same 11 lines of code are repeated in the getAvailables()
   function and in the getUpdates() function. It makes more sense to take the repeated lines
   and make it a standalone function.

2) All four instances of this repeated code were replaced with the encapulating function.

/mp3/jenkins/core/src/main/java/jenkins/Jenkins

3) This code smell is called feature envy because this function should really be in the 
   Jenkins class rather than the Nodes class.

4) The repeated code was eliminated using a loop to handle the repeated cases.

/mp3/jenkins/cli/src/main/java/hudson/cli/Connection.java

5) Both of these were moved to a function where the differing parameter was made a parameter
   of the function.

6) The duplicate code in UpdateTest.java was removed and placed into a helper method
